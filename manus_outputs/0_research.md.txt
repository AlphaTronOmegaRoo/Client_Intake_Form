# AgentSphere Research Summary

## Project Overview
AgentSphere is a SaaS platform for solopreneurs and small businesses. It solves the problem of deploying, managing, and tracking the profitability of multiple autonomous AI agents (e.g., agents running Etsy stores, automated content channels, or social media). The platform provides a no-code "Agent Builder," a unified "Monetization Dashboard," and a "Project Pipeline Manager" to approve or pause agent-generated projects.

## Value Proposition
Stop being the bottleneck in your own business. AgentSphere gives you a 'digital workforce' you can build, manage, and measure from a single dashboard, turning your ideas into automated revenue streams.

## UI Framework & Components
The UI will be built on a modern, utility-first stack: React/Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI for pre-built components. We will leverage component libraries like `reactbits.dev` for common patterns, `MagicUI` for engaging, animated elements, and `21st.dev` for complex data-driven components. The goal is rapid development, consistency, and a clean, responsive experience.

## Brand Gradient
The core brand identity is a dynamic, tech-forward gradient, symbolizing the flow of data and automation.
